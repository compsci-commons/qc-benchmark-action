# QC benchmark action
A generic github action for conducting scientific QC benchmarks.


## Benchmarks

### giab-na12878-exome

Benchmark with chromosome 21 of GIAB NA12878 exome sequencing data.

#### Example workflow

```yaml

## Contributing

To extend this action with additional benchmarks,

* add a new subfolder to the `benchmarks` directory,
* and copy the contents of `benchmarks/dummy` to the new subfolder.

Then, modify the contents according to your needs.
* The `download.sh` script shall contain the code to download the necessary data for conducting the benchmark. It is invoked within the Conda environment defined in `download-env.yaml`.
* The `eval.sh` script shall contain the code to evaluate results generated on the benchmark data. It is invoked within the Conda environment defined in `eval-env.yaml`.

Finally, extend the `README.md` file in the repository root with a description of and an example for using your benchmark.

For inspiration, have a look at `benchmarks/giab-na12878-exome`.
